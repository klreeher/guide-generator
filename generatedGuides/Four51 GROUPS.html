</pre><p>Group 1: Base Product and Price: In my store I want one item to be priced the same for every user that purchases from me. Specifically, I want this item to be $5.00 for every buyer user.</p>
<p>Group 2: Quantity Multiplier: In my store I sell small items by the box load. Every box has the same quantity so I want my buyers to be able to specify their quantity by box while displaying the total quantity they are ordering. Specifically, I want buyer users to order 3 boxes for a total of 3,000 items.</p>
<p>Group 3: Max Quantity: In my store I want users to be able to add their quantity to order manually, but I need to keep them from ordering over a certain quantity of particular items. Specifically, I want to sell an item for any quantity under 1,000</p>
<p>Group 4: Restricted Quantity: In my store I sell small items by the box load. I have 3 different box sizes, but I want the user to select the total quantity in each box. Specifically, I have a product with 3 box sizes: 100, 500, 1,000. I want to restrict the buyer from being able to purchase any quantity other than those 3.</p>
<p>Group 5: Price Breaks: In my store I want to allow my customers to have pricing discounts based on order quantity. Specifically, I&#x2019;d like to be able to offer a 10% discount for every 100 items ordered up to 1,000 items.</p>
<p>Group 6: Multiple Price Assignments: In my organization I need to price products differently by region. Specifically, I need the price of my item to be different between the following regions: East, West. The price for my item for the East region should be $25.00 while the West region should be $30.00.</p>
<p>Group 7: Generate Variants: In my store I want to create products for the different variations of my t-shirts. I&#x2019;d like one product for each combination of size (small, medium, large) and color (indigo, magenta, cyan)</p>
<p>Group 8: Configure Price Quote (CPQ): In my store I want to allow for my users&#x2019; to customize their product and have pricing determined based on the selections. Specifically, I want to create a Notebook product and allow for the following selections: Leatherbound + $5.00, Engraved + $10.00.</p>
